## Goals
Our goal is to create a decentralized ZK-Proof compute marketplace, transforming global idle compute resources into accessible and affordable ZK capabilities.

## Advantages

1. **Liveness**: Decentralized systems use multiple provers, ensuring the protocol operates reliably and doesn't face downtime if some provers are temporarily unavailable. This ensures continuous operation of the system.
2. **Censorship Resistance**: The more provers in a network, the greater the censorship resistance. This is important for maintaining the integrity of transactions and ensuring all valid transactions have an equal opportunity to be included.
3. **Affordability**: Decentralization allows for the creation of third-party proof networks. Applications can outsource their proving to these networks, reducing the overhead for building and running ZK infrastructure. This can lead to cost savings and efficiency in development.
4. **Failure Resilience**: Decentralized systems distribute risk and do not have a single point of failure, significantly enhancing the system's resilience to faults or attacks.
