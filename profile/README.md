Apus Network
Apus Network is a decentralized GPU network built for the AO ecosystem, providing trustless and verifiable computing power for Artificial Intelligence. Our mission is to extend AO's capabilities, enabling verifiable AI inference and the operation of decentralized AI Agents.

Vision
To be the premier infrastructure for verifiable AI within the AO ecosystem, leveraging Arweave's permanent storage and AO's hyper-parallel computing to create a transparent and deterministic environment for complex AI computations.

Key Features
Trustless GPU for AO: We provide a decentralized network of GPUs specifically designed to bring high-performance, verifiable computation to AI tasks running on AO.

Deterministic GPU Execution: By creating an open-source AO extension, we ensure deterministic execution for GPUs. This guarantees that AI inference results are verifiable and trustless, aligning with AO's core principles.

Verifiable AI Inference: Built upon AO's trustless architecture, our network ensures the integrity of the entire AI process, from the model's integrity stored on Arweave to the final inference result.

Incentive Model on AO: We are establishing a competitive economic incentive model through AO and APUS tokens to foster the development and deployment of superior AI models within the ecosystem.
